### Note: The code you see here today does not work. This is a work in progress. 

This repository contains the code for a web service that allows the person who deploys it to run what are known as "Trade Bots", or Steam accounts created with the sole purpose of holding inventory, and trading back and forth for new items. These "Trade Bots" are typically used most by third-party marketplaces, as it allows the website operators to safely and securely trade inventory between users of the site and themselves.

The goal of this project is to democratize the use of these types of accounts, as well as providing an open-source solution for people looking to enter the CS/DOTA/TF2/Rust trading space.
